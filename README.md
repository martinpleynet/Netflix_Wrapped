Recently, I got my Spotify Wrapped for 2020, and I was intrigued whether I could do the same for my Netflix viewing activity this year. I was able to download my Viewing Activity from my Netflix account and put together a dashboard using the dash, plotly, and pandas Python libraries. I also deployed my Netflix Wrapped 2020 dashboard using Heroku.
